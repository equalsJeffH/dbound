    <abstract>
      <t>
        Some Internet client entities on the Internet make inferences
        about the administrative relationships among services on the
        Internet based on the domain names at which they are offered.
        At present, it is not possible to ascertain organizational
        administrative boundaries in the DNS, therefore such
        inferences can be erroneous in various ways.  Mitigation
        strategies deployed so far will not scale.  The solution
        offered in this memo is to provide a means to make
        explicit assertions regarding the administrative relationships
        between domain names.

      target="RFC1034" /> <xref target="RFC1035"
      />) and the omain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) (<xref
      target="RFC4033"  /> <xref target="RFC4034"  /> <xref
      target="RFC4035"  /> <xref target="RFC5155"
       />).</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref target="RFC2119" >RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>To begin, <xref target="motivation"
      /> describes introduces the problem space and motivations for this work. 
      Then, <xref target="usecases" /> discusses the cases
      where a there are needs for discerning administrative boundaries in the DNS
      domain name space.  
      [[TODO:Flesh out]]
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Introduction and Motivation" anchor="motivation">
      <t>Many Internet resources and services, especially at the
      application layer, are identified primarily by DNS domain names
      <xref target="RFC1034"/>. As a result, domain names have become
      fundamental elements in building security policies and also in
      affecting user agent behaviour.  For example, domain names are
      used for defining the scope of HTTP state management "cookies"
      <xref target="RFC6265" />.</t>

      <t>Another example is a user interface convention that
      purports to display an "actual domain name" differently from
      other parts of a fully-qualified domain name, in an effort to
      decrease the success of phishing attacks.  In this strategy, for
      instance, a domain name like
      "www.bank.example.com.attackersite.tld" is formatted to
      highlight that the actual domain name ends in "attackersite.tld", in the
      hope of reducing  user's potential impression of visiting
      "www.bank.example.com".</t>

      <t>Issuers of X.509 certificates make judgements about
      administrative boundaries around domains when issuing the
      certificates.  For some discussion of the relationship between
      domain names and X.509 certificates, see <xref target="RFC6125"
      />.</t>

      <t>The simplest policy, and the one most likely to work, is to
      treat each different domain name distinctly.  Under this
      approach, foo.example.org, bar.example.org, and baz.example.org
      are all just different domains.  Unfortunately, this approach is
      too naive to be useful.  Often, the real policy control
      is the same in several names (in this example, example.org and
      its children).  Therefore, clients have attempted to make more
      sophisticated policies around some idea of such shared control.
      We call such an area of shared control a "policy
      realm", and the control held by the administrator the "policy
      authority".</t>

      <t>Historically, policies were sometimes based on the DNS tree.
      Early policies made a firm distinction between top-level domains
      and everything else; but this was also too naive, and later
      attempts were based on inferences from the domain names themselves.
      That did not work well, because there is no way in the DNS to
      discover the boundaries of policy control around domain
      names.</t>

      <t> Some have attempted to use the boundary of zone cuts
      (i.e. the location of the zone's apex, which is at the SOA
      record; see <xref target="RFC1034" /> and <xref target="RFC1035"
      />).  That boundary is neither necessary nor sufficient for
      these purposes: it is possible for a large site to have many,
      administratively distinct subdomain-named sites without
      inserting an SOA record, and it is also possible that an
      administrative entity (like a company) might divide its domain
      up into different zones for administrative reasons unrelated to
      the names in that domain.  It was also, prior to the advent of
      DNSSEC, difficult to find zone cuts.  Regardless, the location
      of a zone cut is an administrative matter to do with the
      operation of the DNS itself, and not useful for determining
      relationships among services offered at names in the DNS.</t>

      <t>These different issues often appear to be different kinds
      of problems.  The issue of whether two names may set cookies for
      one another appears to be a different matter from whether two
      names get the same highlighting in a browser's address bar, or
      whether a particular name "owns" all the names underneath it.
      But the problems all boil down to the same fundamental problem,
      which is that of determining whether two different names in the
      DNS are under the control of the same entity and ought to be
      treated as having an important administrative relationship to
      one another.</t>

      <t>What appears to be needed is a mechanism to determine
      policy boundaries in the DNS.  That is, given two domain
      names, one needs to be able to answer whether the first and the
      second are under the same administrative control and same
      administrative policies.  We may call this state of affairs
      "being within the same policy realm".  We may suppose that, if
      this information were to be available, it would be possible to
      make useful decisions based on the information.</t>

      <t>A particularly important distinction for security purposes is
      the one between names that are mostly used to contain other
      domains, as compared to those that are mostly used to operate
      services.  The former are often "delegation-centric" domains,
      delegating parts of their name space to others, and are
      frequently called "public suffix" domains or "effective TLDs".
      The term "public suffix" comes from a site, 
        <xref target="publicsuffix.org"/>,
      that publishes a list of domains 

        -- which is also known as the "effective TLD (eTLD) list", and
        henceforth in this specification as the "public suffix list"
        --

        that are used to contain other domains.  Not all, but
      most, delegation-centric domains are public suffix domains; and
      not all public suffix domains need to do DNS delegation,
      although most of them do.  The reason for the public suffix list
      is to make the distinction between names that must never be
      treated as being in the same policy realm as another,
      and those that might be so treated.  For instance, if "com" is
      on the public suffix list, that means that "example.com" lies in
      a policy realm distinct from that of com.
      </t>

      <t>Unfortunately, the public suffix list has several inherent
      limitations.  To begin with, it is a list that is separately
      maintained from the list of DNS delegations.  As a result, the
      data in the public suffix list can diverge from the actual use
      of the DNS.  Second, because its semantics are not the same as
      those of the DNS, it does not capture unusual features of the
      DNS that are a consequence of its structure (see <xref
      target="RFC1034" /> for background on that structure).  Third,
      as the size of the root zone grows, keeping the list both
      accurate and synchronized with the expanding services will
      become difficult and unreliable.  Perhaps most importantly, it
      puts the power of assertion about the operational policies of a
      domain outside the control of the operators of that domain, and
      in the control of a third party possibly unrelated to those
      operators.</t>

      <t>There have been suggestions for improvements of the public
      suffix list,  most notably in <xref
      target="I-D.pettersen-subtld-structure" />. It is unclear
      the extent to which those improvements would help, because they
      represent improvements on the fundamental mechanism of keeping
      metadata about the DNS tree apart from the DNS tree itself.</t>

    <section title="Use Cases" anchor="usecases">

      <t>In the most general sense, this memo presents a mechanism
      that can be used either as a replacement of the public suffix
      list <xref target="publicsuffix.org"/>, or else as a way to build
      and maintain such a list.  The mechanism outlined here is
      explicitly restricted to names having ancestor-descendant or
      sibling relationships, but only as a practical matter; nothing
      about the mechanism makes that restriction a requirement.</t>

            Using this mechansim, it is possible to determine whether
            a service at one name may be permitted to set a cookie for
            a service at a different name.  (Other protocols use
            cookies, too, and those approaches could benefit

           However, after hearing about cross-domain requirements of cookies and 
           cross-domain security use cases in the browser, it strikes me that any 
           functionality (policy authority?) that allows domains to be linked would 
           be incredibly useful in the DMARC world, too.  DMARC?s requirement for
            Identifier Alignment between SPF-authenticated domain, DKIM d=domain, 
            and a message?s From: domain could be relaxed to include domains that 
            were somehow associated via a policy authority.

           This capability would be *very* nice to have at hand.

<abstract><t>
     The email ecosystem currently lacks a cohesive mechanism through which email
   senders and receivers can make use of multiple authentication protocols in an
   attempt to establish reliable domain identifiers.  This lack of cohesion
   prevents receivers from providing domain-specific feedback to senders regarding
   the accuracy of authentication deployments.  Inaccurate authentication
   deployments preclude receivers from safely taking deterministic action against
   email that fails authentication checks.  Finally, email senders do not have the
   ability to publish policies specifying actions that should be taken against
   email that fails multiple authentication checks.  This memo presents a proposal
   for a scalable mechanism by which an organization can express, using the Domain
   Name System, domain-level policies and preferences for message validation,
   disposition, and reporting with predictable and accurate results.  The enclosed
   proposal is not intended to introduce mechanisms that provide elevated delivery
   privilege of authenticated email.  The proposal presents a mechanism for policy
   distribution that enables a continuum of increasingly strict handling of
   messages that fail multiple authentication checks, from no action, through
   silent reporting, up to message rejection.

   This document defines the term "Public Suffix domain" as meaning a domain under
   which multiple parties that are unaffiliated with the owner of the Public Suffix
   domain may register subdomains.  Examples of Public Suffix domains include
   "org", "co.uk", "k12.wa.us" and "uk.com".  It also defines a file format that
   can be used to distribute information about such Public Suffix domains to
   relying parties.  As an example, this information is then used to limit which
   domains an Internet service can set HTTP cookies for, strengthening the rules
   already defined by the cookie specification.  This specification updates RFC
   6265 [RFC6265] by defining the term "Public Suffix domain".

<abstract>
<t>
   [RFC1034] provided a description of how to cache negative responses.
   It however had a fundamental flaw in that it did not allow a name
   server to hand out those cached responses to other resolvers, thereby
   greatly reducing the effect of the caching.  This document addresses
   issues raise in the light of experience and replaces [RFC1034 Section
   4.3.4].
</t>
<t>
   Negative caching was an optional part of the DNS specification and
   deals with the caching of the non-existence of an RRset [RFC2181] or
   domain name.
</t>
<t>
   Negative caching is useful as it reduces the response time for
   negative answers.  It also reduces the number of messages that have
   to be sent between resolvers and name servers hence overall network
   traffic.  A large proportion of DNS traffic on the Internet could be
   eliminated if all resolvers implemented negative caching.  With this
   in mind negative caching should no longer be seen as an optional part
   of a DNS resolver.
